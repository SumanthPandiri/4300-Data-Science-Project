In this paper, we identify significant differences between PMS (Phelan-McDermid syndrome) patients and control cell lines, identify candidate pathways that are particularly affected in individuals with PMS, and identify subgroups within the PMS population based on their metabolic profiles. The data for this project was generated using the Biolog Phenotype Mammalian Microarrays: this technology measures the production of energy (NADH) in the presence of different metabolic compounds.
